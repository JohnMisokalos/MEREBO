This Folder includes datasets thta are used by the algorithm:

total.xlsx is the complete list of downloaded items from the stores
artificialsetsmalltrain.xlsx is the dataset used for training our algorithm in this example
solruporiginal.xlsx is a dataset that was created by picking random items from the total dataset and trying to find matches between them. BEcause of the relative small amount of items we could include because of processing power limitations, a lot of items are left with no matches.
solrup.csv is same dataset as the previous one, trimmed of the instances of no matches, to make it more realistic as to what we would see in the website
